# System alias file - try to fetch ftn-style aliases from there.
# If "from" address of a message from FidoNet matches _right_ side
# of some entry in sysalias file, then the Reply-To: header is created
# in the RFC message with the name part taken from the left side of the
# sysalis entry and domain part taken from myfqdn (below). E.g., if a 
# fidonet message comes from "John Smith of 1:234/567.89@fidonet" and 
# there is an entry in the sysalias file:
# "jsmith:	John.Smith@p89.f567.n234.z1.fidonet.org"
# and fqdn value is "pccross.msk.su", then the resulting message will

#         where <operator> is '=', '!=', '<', '>', '<=', '>='
# - address <wildcard>

#         e.g. "5020/*"
# - time <interval>[,<interval>,...]

# \t	tab (0x09)
# \b	backspace (0x08)

# ModemPort present a blank-separated list of ports with possible speed

# PhoneTrans lines provide rules to change phone prefixes to make local

# the prefix is stripped and the 7-digit remainder is dialed.  For
# the numbers starting with "7-" but not with "7-095-", the country prefix
# "7-" is stripped and the long-distance dialing prefix "8W" substituted. 
# For the numbers not matching any of the above, international
# call is performed: international dialing prefix "8W10" is prepended
# to the unmodified 11-digit number.  Generally, the syntax is:
# "PhoneTrans <what-to-strip> / <what-to-substitute-instead>"

# means really hold "hold" type packets and files: do not send them
# if our system initiated the session, "NoHold" means  send "hold"
# packets when our system initiated the session. "NoPUA" stands for
# "No PickUp All", i.e. PUP ("Pick Up Primary").  NoCall means do not

# explicitly specified in the command line.
# Default options are "everything allowed".
